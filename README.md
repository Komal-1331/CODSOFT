This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of my internship. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling using Python. The projects included are: 
Iris Flower Classification

Description: This project involves the classification of Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Techniques Used: Data visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine).
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description: This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced with a very small percentage of fraud cases. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, Handling imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks).
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras.
Sales Prediction

Description: This project aims to predict future sales for a retail store based on historical sales data. The objective is to build a model that can forecast sales to help with inventory management and business planning.
Techniques Used: Time series analysis, Data visualization, Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ARIMA, and LSTM).
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras.
Each project folder contains detailed Jupyter notebooks that explain the problem statement, data preprocessing steps, model building, evaluation metrics, and conclusions. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions.
